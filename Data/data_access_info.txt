Data Access Information (February 21, 2025)

Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)
- This CSV file can be downloaded by going to https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html
  and clicking the KOI Table (Cumulative list) under the Kepler section.
- After clicking, you will be transferred to a table that can be downloaded through the 
  "Download Table" button.
- Make sure to select options to include all columns, all rows, and save as a CSV.
- To use the scripts for this project, name it "KOI_cumulative.csv".
- This table will have contextual data for each transit such as its corresponding star, disposition, etc.
- The CSV file can be directly scanned into the Pandas library as a data frame.

KOI Light Curves
- For the stars that appear in the KOI table, their light curves can be downloaded through https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/bulk_data_download/
- Under Kepler Time Series Scripts, download the Kepler KOI dataset which is a file named "Kepler_KOI_wget.bat"
- This bat file has a wget command on each line with two file formats for light curve data. Only ".tbl" files are of interest.
- wget is a command-line utility that can download an internet file and for installation refer to https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/batch_download_help.html
- Note that these commands have single quotations which may need to be converted to double quotations for Windows
- As of milestone 1, the "data_collection.ipynb" included takes care of this quotation conversion, only downloads ".tbl" extensions, and selects features
  that are relevant to the project and stores them in an SQLite database titled "light_curves.db" with the table titled "LightCurve".
- To replicate the milestone 1 process, the notebook should be manually stopped after downloading the first 2680 stars.
- The download process could take hours or days depending on the system used.
- This database has star ID, time, flux, etc. which is closer to the raw data collected by Kepler.
